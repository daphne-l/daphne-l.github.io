     <p><b>Entry 11</b></p>
<p>This week I continued to work on my outfit creation project. I added two more accessories, necklaces and socks, to the project. I also tried to fix the issue of the labels reappearing after it was already fixed but it only partly worked and I’m hoping to completely fix it in Monday’s class.
</p>
    <p><b>Entry 10</b></p>
<p>This week I finished my data representation project which wasn’t really data representation but instead was a project that picked my outfit. I used the same skills in this project that I used in the gift for my brother such as arrays and event listeners. One thing that I thought was important was that I was able to use a if then statement in this project which I was looking forward to using. I needed it because I wanted to make sure that the counter that made it so the clothing rotated through resetted when it reached the end. I want to add more accessories such as necklaces and bracelets but for now the project is completed.
</p>
     <p><b>Entry 09</b></p>
<p>I worked on finishing my how it works presentation this week. Mine is on social media algorithms and the harms and risks they pose. This is actually a topic that is interesting to me so I was happy to work on my presentation. It should be pushed on my website under the projects page if you want to look at it. This week I also worked on the designs for the knives for the project for my brother. I’m a little worried about whether there will be enough time this week for me to get the help I need in order to finish my project.
</p>
       <p><b>Entry 08</b></p>
<p>This week I started working on my computer science Christmas gift for my brother. In this gift he will click on a box and it will give him a random knife with a different percent chance of appearing. (I’m not entirely sure how to explain it.) This is based off of his favorite video game but is different because I will customize all of the knives so they fit his interests. In order to code this I’ve decided to make an array of the different knife rarity, common, uncommon, rare, legendary, godly, and chroma. The problem is that the percentages do not add up to 100% so it will probably be more complex than I think it will. Last week I started my code and worked on drawing the designs for the knives. This week I’m looking forward to experimenting with javascript in hopes of getting the project to work.
</p>
    <p><b>Entry 07</b></p>
<p>This week I made a thanksgiving project! This was my first real project which uses javascript so I’m pretty proud of it. I created a function which sets the inner text of a div to a random word selected from a word bank I made with math random. I then added an event listener that listens for a click and then changes the inner text again. I won’t tell you what it changes to so it’s a surprise for you to see when you check out my projects page. The rest of this project was done in CSS.
</p>
     <p><b>Entry 06</b></p>
<p>One thing I tried to make this week was a website where divs would appear and change color when you click on them. I had trouble figuring out how to do this and in the end the website still didn’t work. I am going to schedule a lab so I can get some help.
</p>
    <p><b>Entry 05</b></p>
<p>This week I got help on how to change a div when I hover over another div. I used addEventListener to successfully get my page to function how I wanted it to. The event listener “listens” for when your mouse hovers over the window by using mouseenter and mouseleave. It tells you which window you are hovering over so you know what you are clicking on and gives you instructions on what to do when you aren't clicking on anything. With this addition, my website is almost done! The only thing I have left to do is change up the divs so the site maintains its appearance on different sized windows.
</p>
    <p><b>Entry 04</b></p>
<p>In Javascript a variable is basically a new thing. The comparison that helps me understand functions is comparing them to recipes. They are the instructions but they also need instructions to work. In my most rescind codesketch I used functions to create the divs on the page. One important thing I learned in js is document.getElementById(“”) which gets an element in your code. I tried to incorporate functions into my main website page but I couldn't figure out how.
</p> 
  <p><b>Entry 03</b></p>
<p>In CS1 we learned how to make animations this week! I used this skill to make my first project called “heart animation.” It’s very simple but I think it looks good. I won’t tell you what it is though because you have to look for yourself :). One thing that frustrated me while making this project was that I had trouble getting the image I wanted to show up on the website. I solved this by using the inspect feature we were taught to figure out the problem!
</p> 
<p><b>Entry 02</b></p>
<p>This week I tried brainstorming an idea for my first project. I think it will be cool to have it change depending on the time of day but I’m not completely sure yet. I’m really excited about making my website look good so that is what I spent the week doing. I drew the background images for my journal and projects pages on my iPad. Now I just need to make the projects to put in the pages!</p>
<p><b>Entry 01</b></p>
<p>Hello! This is my first entry ever! I’ve learned so much in CS1 so far just after a few sessions! My favorite thing I learned was how to make divs because it has been really useful in making my website so far. My website is going along well and right now I'm working on my goal to complete the front page of my website. I think I've made good progress but I’m currently stuck on how to make one div appear in front of another.</p>
