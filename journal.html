    <p><b>Entry 05</b></p>
<p>This week I got help on how to change a div when I hover over another div. I used addEventListener to successfully get my page to function how I wanted it to. The event listener “listens” for when your mouse hovers over the window by using mouseenter and mouseleave. It tells you which window you are hovering over so you know what you are clicking on and gives you instructions on what to do when you aren't clicking on anything. With this addition, my website is almost done! The only thing I have left to do is change up the divs so the site maintains its appearance on different sized windows.

<p>In Javascript a variable is basically a new thing. The comparison that helps me understand functions is comparing them to recipes. They are the instructions but they also need instructions to work. In my most rescind codesketch I used functions to create the divs on the page. One important thing I learned in js is document.getElementById(“”) which gets an element in your code. I tried to incorporate functions into my main website page but I couldn't figure out how.

<p>In CS1 we learned how to make animations this week! I used this skill to make my first project called “heart animation.” It’s very simple but I think it looks good. I won’t tell you what it is though because you have to look for yourself :). One thing that frustrated me while making this project was that I had trouble getting the image I wanted to show up on the website. I solved this by using the inspect feature we were taught to figure out the problem!

<p><b>Entry 02</b></p>
<p>This week I tried brainstorming an idea for my first project. I think it will be cool to have it change depending on the time of day but I’m not completely sure yet. I’m really excited about making my website look good so that is what I spent the week doing. I drew the background images for my journal and projects pages on my iPad. Now I just need to make the projects to put in the pages!</p>
<p><b>Entry 01</b></p>
<p>Hello! This is my first entry ever! I’ve learned so much in CS1 so far just after a few sessions! My favorite thing I learned was how to make divs because it has been really useful in making my website so far. My website is going along well and right now I'm working on my goal to complete the front page of my website. I think I've made good progress but I’m currently stuck on how to make one div appear in front of another.</p>
